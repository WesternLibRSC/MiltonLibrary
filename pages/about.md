## About the Collection

The University of Western Ontario’s Archives and Special Collections boast numerous unique collections, with one standout being the G. William Stuart Collection of Milton and Miltoniana. Acquired by Western in 1968 and expanded over the years, it stands as Canada’s foremost collection of its kind. Housing a comprehensive array of John Milton's works, from early editions to later ones, including multiple copies of the 1645 Poems and over a hundred editions of Paradise Lost, the collection is enriched further with seventeenth-century political and religious imprints, featuring numerous pamphlets.

This site higlights the Milton Collection at Western University and on going Milton research & projects. You browse the images scanned from the Milton collection generally or filter using the image tags. High resoulution copies of the images will be available on <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/miltonatwestern/">Scholarship@Western</a> (coming soon).
