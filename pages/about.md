## About the Collection

This site higlights the Milton Collection at Western University and on going Milton research & projects. Blah... blah... blah...
- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
