## About the Collection

The University of Western Ontario’s Archives and Special Collections boast numerous unique collections, with one standout being the G. William Stuart Collection of Milton and Miltoniana. Acquired by Western in 1968 and expanded over the years, it stands as Canada’s foremost collection of its kind. Housing a comprehensive array of John Milton's works, from early editions to later ones, including multiple copies of the 1645 Poems and over a hundred editions of Paradise Lost, the collection is enriched further with seventeenth-century political and religious imprints, featuring numerous pamphlets.

## About John Leonard's Project

Dr. John Leonard's area of interest in both teaching and research is John Milton’s poetry, which he has edited for Penguin Classics. His most recent book, a reception history of Paradise Lost entitled Faithful Labourers, has been published in two volumes by Oxford University Press in January 2013. This passion project of Dr. Leonards resulted from lockdown time during COVID, during this time he decided to record himself reading Paradise Lost. 

Looking for a home for his videos and means to illustrate them, Dr. Leonard reached out to Western Archvies. Deb Meert-Williston connect him with the RSC team. The RSC team supplied the scanned images and Dr. Leonard's son, Alex Leonard, helped incorpate them into the video along with images created by Dr. Leonard through AI, and images from other Milton holdings around the world. With a desire to showcase the videos and the Milton collection Milton@Western was born. 

Alex Leonard is the Founder & CEO of AL Media and can be found: <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/miltonatwestern/">info@alexleonardmedia.com</a> and <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/miltonatwestern/">www.alexleonardmedia.com</a>
