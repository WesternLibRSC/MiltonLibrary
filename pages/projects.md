 ## About John Leonard's Project

Dr. John Leonard's area of interest in both teaching and research is John Miltonâ€™s poetry, which he has edited for Penguin Classics. His most recent book, a reception history of Paradise Lost entitled Faithful Labourers, has been published in two volumes by Oxford University Press in January 2013. This passion project of Dr. Leonards resulted from lockdown time during COVID, during this time he decided to record himself reading Paradise Lost. 

Looking for a home for his videos and means to illustrate them, Dr. Leonard reached out to Western Archvies. Deb Meert-Williston connect him with the RSC team. The RSC team supplied the scanned images and Dr. Leonard's son, Alex Leonard, helped incorpate them into the video along with images created by Dr. Leonard through AI, and images from other Milton holdings around the world. With a desire to showcase the videos and the Milton collection Milton@Western was born. 

Alex Leonard is the Founder & CEO of AL Media and can be found: <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/miltonatwestern/">info@alexleonardmedia.com</a> and <a href="https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/miltonatwestern/">www.alexleonardmedia.com</a>
